            <p class="card-body fw-bold mb-0">Main Characters: Krekdar, Hymaeril, Zeukril Thunderaxe</p>
            <p class="card-body">Long ago, the lands were ruled by Wyrms - the progenitors of modern dragons. When their god Hymaeril bestowed the secrets of immortality to an emperor of lizardfolk, his brother god Krekdar interfered. The emperor bred a new, magical body for his soul - but Krekdar gave the body its own soul. This new creature took the name Zeukril, and became Krekdar's avatar in the ensuing war. The Wyrmlords all chose one brother's side, and the chaos shattered the great lizardfolk civilisation they ruled. Hymaeril triumphed, but the Wyrms were broken. They formed a new society and vowed to never again interfere in the lives of lesser creatures.</p>

            "The Fireblood"</h5>
            <p class="card-body mb-0 fw-bold">Main Characters: Azex Fireblood, Balturin Thaneslayer, Meriksus of Vengeance</p>
            <p class="card-body mb-0">Azex and Balturin were the last of the Kratu Gei, the progenitor race of modern humans. They lived as brothers until Azex's new bride was murdered. Azex blamed Balturin, and battled him in a vengeful fury. Meriksus intervened, but Azex slew him and Balturin. His misplaced revenge angered Daelia, Goddess of Vengeance, so she bound his soul to Meriksus and imposed a geas. Azex would find the murderer, and Meriksus would share his body. The young priest's wisdom and guidance led to the killer, and when Azex slew her, he was sent to the afterlife while Meriksus inherited his body.</p>

            <p class="card-body mb-0">The Kamir, derisively known as halflings today, are mostly gregarious and pacifistic. Ostra Parii decided to take up arms against the goblin raiders of the Singing Spear tribe. He roused a few hundred beleaguered peasants to arms and led them out to strike the goblins' home. Chief Ykthpinggoktt easily outwitted and devastated them. Ostra was allowed to survive, delivered back to his people as an example. The Kamir lamented his folly. They cast him out of their communities, and his wife Gypsos and her children with him. It is claimed the words 'pariah' and 'gypsy' are derived from their names.</p>

            <p class="card-body mb-0">Azeltekaron rules the known world. Five great heroes learn the secret of her reign - she is controlling the minds of millions! They rally their peoples to fight back: Desca brings those who wield the power of the Pantheon; Ceurint marshals the dwarves; Pheeloph leads an armada of free ships; Tephys gathers wizards from every tower; Ceurint rallies sorcerers, malcontents and the dispossessed. Together, their forces smash Azeltekaron's defenses, and the five heroes vanquish her in the keep of her mountain citadel.</p>

            <p class="card-body mb-0">Time and obligations wear on the usurpers. The ideological rift between Tephys, the master wizard, and Kulas, the greatest sorcerer, becomes a gaping wound when Ceurint succumbs to old wounds. Desca and Pheeloph are unable to broker a peace between them; instead, Tephys and Kulas start a duel that draws in every Tower of the Arcanum. At the climax, Kulas summons a colossal titan of earth from the sea, so massive one footstep onto the land smashes a thriving port city. Tephys bends all the winds of the world and pushes it back down - sending up a tsunami to wash away countless costal settlements around the world. Kulas yields, gathers his sorcerers, and makes a new home for them on the island which had been his titan. They enchant the rock, and sail it away.</p>

            <p class="card-body mb-0">A god of strength beds the champion of a thousand athletic competitions. Caathryn is born of the union, her half-god blood granting her strength beyond any mortal measure. Many more gods take mortals as consorts, and within a century there are hundreds more godsblood offspring, superior to mortals in almost every way, and each posessing a unique gift. Khulatra, the highest Paladin of the Elf-Mother Goddess Vythy Roan, was commanded to raise an army to stand against them. However, she had fallen in love with the godsblood wizard Xmgn. Grenwald, the mightiest sorcerer since Kulas, discovered her secret when he brought the Colosaen sorcerers to join her. Khulatra defied her god's command to kill Xmgn, and was cursed with darkness, to be blinded by the Suns and live beneath the earth forevermore. Every elf who lamented her punishment was cursed the same; thus were born the Khulaen - dark elves. Caathryn rallied the godsbloods to face the gathered strength of the mortals. Grenwald raised a mountain around her, imprisoning her and her ilk within a giant pillar of stone. Grenwald was celebrated as a great and benevolent hero, for no mortal blood was shed.</p>

            <p class="card-body mb-0">Not all the offspring of gods joined Caathryn, some even earning respect and honor among mortals. When the godsblood general Khrl disappears with his army in the wilderness inland of the Great Eastern Empire, his sons decide to search for him. They find him retreating with the remnant of his legion, harried by a dark horde of monsters and their mysterious shadow of a leader. They led the monsters to the great fortified city Del Rei. There they met the paladin Harem, who led the city's defense when it was besieged by the monsters, dying at the gate to protect refugees. The siege was long and bitter, and finally broken when the reclusive Colashy Sorcerers were convinced to strike from their island redoubt. Khrl fell in single combat with the mysterious dark figure when the siege broke, and the brothers pursued them into the wilderness. They were betrayed by Lrjn's phoenix familiar, and lost.</p>

These three are hired by Chancellor Losc Sunbreather of the Magi Council to gather artifacts and deliver them to the Magi vaults for safekeeping. His adventuring seekers discover his plot to use them in a bid to rule the world, and topple him from power. Losc calls on Towers of the Tifeshy and Colashy to join him against the corrupt and languid Magi Council, creating a schism among the Magi. Most Towers of the Arcanum fall; Losc's own, Tower the Seventh, survives - but he vanishes. Just as he disappears, a horde of monsters pours out of the wilderness, and the seekers must utilize the artifacts to drive it back. They meet the horde's leader Aioc, daughter of Khulatra and Xmgn, and she challenges them. Skyh-Lrjn is mortally wounded, and must be left behind. Lady Arthen and Balturin are never seen again, and some tales end with them battling Aioc eternally, sustained by the power of the artifacts they wield.</p>

They find Hxva ripe with child, and are discovered trying to escape. Skylar challenges Faar to a contest of riddles and puzzles, distracting him and his thralls while Meric steals away with Hxva. They do not get far before Hxva's child comes early, and the baby soon drinks his mother dry of blood. Meric cannot kill the child because it is the father's only weakness. The world grows darker as Faar expands his influence in search of his son, but Skylar's last spell conceals the child, allowing Meric to raise him.</p>
